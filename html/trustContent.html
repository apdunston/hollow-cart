<!--
    Trust Content is a multiplayer (best with 2) maze game. There are a series of scenes.
    The collection of scenes--taken together--are an act. Once players play through an  
    act, the second act begins. It is the same set of scenes, but goo starts coming
    out to get the players. Each successive act, the goo gets faster. Trust Content 
    tracks the total number of scenes the players complete. That's their score. Players
    are welcome to assign meaning to the score as they please. Just like everything else
    in life.
